An exercise in learning D3 for DOM manipulation and transitions.

Uses CSS (3D) transforms where available, falls back to normal CSS if not.

Coordinate and tile positioning logic cribbed from Modest Maps. 

A ~~one~~ two day hack... Doubtless still glitches to be ironed out! 

No projections, no layers, no double click, no touching, no overlays.

Queueing img requests seems overkill but smooths things out a lot.
