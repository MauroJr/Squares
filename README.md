An exercise in learning D3 for DOM manipulation and transitions.

There's a CSS 3D transform mode in here as well, but this version just uses normal CSS.

Coordinate and tile positioning logic cribbed from Modest Maps. 

A one day hack... Doubtless still glitches to be ironed out!

Queueing img requests seems overkill but smooths things out a lot.
